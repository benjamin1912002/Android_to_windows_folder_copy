# Android_to_windows_folder_copy.
Small script that pulls a folder from an android device into windows by using adb commands within a .bat file
Just written as an easy and quick way for my mother to backup photos from her cellphone to the pc
The script creates a folder with the format yyyy_mm_dd and stores the pulled folder from the cellphone inside, then erases the folder from the cellphone.
Of course you will need adb tools in your pc and usb debugging activated on the phone.
